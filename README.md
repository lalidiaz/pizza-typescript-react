[pizza app](https://pizza-typescript.web.app/) 

Typescript + ReactJs

To see the demo clone the repo and run npm install :)

I had so much fun creating this Pizza app. 
Topics covered: 
- stored pizzas in local storage. If you reload the page it will still keep your pizzas added to your cart.
- Context API.
- Created a HOC (High Order Component).
-  Created a Render Props Component.
- Created a Custom Hook.
- Framer motion (Animations).

Have fun creating your own pizza, drag and drop the ingredients, hover over the pizzas in menu page and check the latest offers!
